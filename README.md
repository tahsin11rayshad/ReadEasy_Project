# Welcome to ReadEasy!

We all love to read books, right? Some of us try to read multiple books without finishing the one we are currently reading and after several days when we again take those books we forget where were we last time. So we start reading from the top again. This is where ReadEasy comes.

ReadEasy is a Java console application for keeping records of your books and book readings. The **sole purpose** of this project was to build an application by following **SOLID principles** of Object Oriented Concepts. 

By using this application a user can:
1. Add information about author
2. Add information about publisher
3. Add various types of books
4. Add and remove bookmarks
5. Generate various types of reports about the user's bookshelf.

This is the **UML Class Diagram** of ReadEasy application

I have not only followed the SOLID principles, also used various design patterns such as **Factory Method Pattern** and **Singleton Pattern**.  I have also tried to avoid as much code smells as I can.
